infrared thermometers with the MLX90614 Infrared Thermometer sensor from Melexis.
Most of the projects weâ€™ve seen use the Arduino.  

In one of our current sensor projects, we wanted to adapt the MLX90614 for use with an Atmega48.  
We programmed this project in Arduino as a stepping-stone for another project.
